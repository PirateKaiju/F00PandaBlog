# F00Panda

## A minimalistic and free blogging system, inspired by [bearblog](https://github.com/HermanMartinus/bearblog/), made in PHP

**Project current status is 'In Development, but usable'**

## Features

* Self-hosted, you just need a server (local or remote) to run your own F00Panda-based blog;

* Markdown for content writing and (optional) WYSIWYG support;

* Multi-user support;

* Minimalistic design as a whole (both backend and frontend), no overhead, it is made to run with one of the simplest stacks;

* Quick setup;

## Architectural Decisions:

* Symfony Framework 

* Sqlite ( but it can easily switch to any RDBMS )

* Bulma CSS Framework and a little bit of JS

* (optional) SimpleMDE
